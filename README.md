# Covid-19-Mask-Checker-

In the crisis of Covid-19, I have developed a simple covid-19 mask detector. As we know covid-19 is a disease which can spread easily. Wearing a mask can reduce the spread upto some extend. So the above trained model can be implemented in a CC TV, which in turn can detect individuals without mask. I have trained a Convolutional Neural Network for the same and got an accuracy of 98.88% on the training set and 98.68% on the test set. This model has been imported for further classification purposes.
